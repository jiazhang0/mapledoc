* Self-remarks:

  In past one year, I succeeded to fulfill scheduled work and some exploratory jobs: 
    1. investigate arch arm64 support for WRLinux. Base on yocoto 1.7 M3, I migrated patches from Linaro and fix many build failure to make a valid arm64 image. Then work together with MG guys to provides them an usable platform to develop toolchain. After that, I have been working create qemuarm64 bsp for WRLinux and have a excellent progress.
    2. take part in WRL 6 CGP profile development and in charge of cluster part, I upgraded cluster related packages to latest version, such as corosync, openais, pacemaker and so on. And then created a clutter server with thest packages to feature cluster of CGP works. I also fix a lot of defects including build failures, runtime test build failures. And sync with upstream and push local revs back were done periodically.
    3. Work with Liezhi to develop installer for WRL6. I have 158 wrlinux commits in last year.

  Besides I also take part in ycoto developemt and have 58 yocto commits in passing year.

* Self-remarks:

  During last year, I did great work to accomplish all of assigned work. For the aarch64 work, I succeeds to create an initial bsp and make it work for oe-core with high quality codes. During the time cooperation with MG guys, I met their requirement efficiently. And for WRLinux 6 CGP work, I fulfilled all the new features, packages upgrade and all kinds of defects fix. I also achieved the requirement from BSP team in short with hight quility code in WRLinux 6 installer development.

  在过去一年，我极其出色的完成了各项分配的工作。对于aarch64的探索性的工作，成功的使能oe-core对其bsp的支持。并且在与MG合作的过程中，及时高效的相应了对方的需求。在开发WRLinux 6 CGP的过程中，保质保量的完成了各项新feature的开发，包的升级以及各种失败的修复。在WRLinux 6 installer的开发工作中更是在极短的时间内高效高质的完成兄弟部门bsp提出的需求。

  在参与yocto社区开发中，已较高的代码质量和参与的热情赢得社区的尊重。

## Timeliness of Delivery of Output

Always finishes everything on time. Accoring the tasks in schedule, make plans and designs accordingly. Among the development of WRLinux 6 CGP and installer, alway commit codes and resolve the problems with efficient performance.
  根据已有计划中的任务，较为详细的做出相应的规划和设计。在WRLinux6 CGP的开发过程中，能够按照时间表完成所分配的工作。在WRLinux 6.0 installer的开发过程中，更是保质保量按时完成feature的开发和bug fix的工作。甚至对于某些突发的需求，可以提前完成。

## Use of Resources

* Self-remarks:

Regularly uses fewer resources in terms of time, material. Such as when something is needed to print, print on both sides.

这块写的不对。

有效的使用工作时间来完成工作。严格的按照时间表来规划使用时间，分配多少时间回邮件，多少时间解bug， 又有多少时间来学习，提升自己的业务能力/code capability?

## Customer Impact / Value Added

Delivered platform and services of aarch64 bsp to MG guys that consistently meet and sometimes exceed their needs and expectation. Reflect quickly about  their requirement and I think feedback from them must be positive.

 Produces goods and services that consistently meet and sometimes exceed the standards and expectations of internal and external customers. Always up-to-date about customer needs and expectations. The feedback from customers is almost always positive.
