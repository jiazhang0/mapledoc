Questionsï¼š
1 command evlgentmpls needs its 2nd parameter has a '.log' section
2 evlog assume the size of 'long double' on powerpc is 8 bytes, but right now is 16 byte.

Answers:
1 check the way why '.log' section is created. Search a lot but no result. When check
  http://evlog.sourceforge.net/evlgentmpls.html, it says:

  When you compile a C file containing calls to syslogat(), information
  about each call is recorded in the .log section of the resulting object file.

  But I don't know why '.log' section doesn't be created even syslogat() are called.

  At last modificate the test case. Check section in object file first. If no such section, SKIP it.

2 The fix is simple, pass "-mlong-double-64" to compiler.

  But the process to fix this problem is not right. Of course, I thought the gcc parameter first. But I
  didn't got the answer somehow. Maybe I should read the gcc manual one option by another.

  Then I try to fix it by modificate its source code. Then I learn the format of float, double and
  long double. But it seems beyond my capbility. The size of 'long double' is 12 bytes on x86 while 16 bytes
  on powerpc. It is hard to finish the convert. I even thought to read the source code of perl or python.
  There must be such convert functions.

  Luckly, during the writing code, I got the gcc option to fix it.

What I learn:
DON'T PANIC.
