linux log system

All I can say is that most linux distributions use rsyslog as default log system. It replace the old syslogd and klogd(right?). 

It has many configure files, and the most important one is /etc/rsyslog.conf. It also has a file /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.confÂ to define the exact log file. For example, system call syslog(3) logs information to /var/log/syslog is defined there.


/var/log/lastlog: lastlog 
/var/log/message: # dmesg output the content of the kernel buffer, the buffer maybe overwrite.
/var/log/secure:  
/var/log/btmp:    lastb
/var/log/wtmp:    last
/var/log/utmp:    who/w

As with systemd distribution, it has systemd its own log system.
